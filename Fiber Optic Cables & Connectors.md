### **1. Fiber Optic Cables**

Fiber optic cables are used for high-speed data transmission over long distances with minimal signal degradation. There are two main types of fiber optic cables:

#### **Multi-Mode Fiber**
- **Light Source**: Uses **LEDs** (Light Emitting Diodes).
- **Core Size**: Larger core diameter (typically 50 or 62.5 micrometers), which allows multiple modes (paths) of light to travel through the core.
- **Cable Color**: Typically **orange**.
- **Usage**: Ideal for short-distance communication (up to 2 km) and is commonly used within buildings or local networks.
- **Connectors**: Commonly uses **LC**, **SC**, **ST**, and **MT-RJ** connectors.

#### **Single-Mode Fiber**
- **Light Source**: Uses **lasers** (Laser Diodes).
- **Core Size**: Smaller core diameter (typically 8 to 10 micrometers), which allows only one mode of light to travel.
- **Cable Color**: Typically **yellow**.
- **Usage**: Designed for long-distance communication (up to 100 km or more) and is used for high-speed and long-haul applications.
- **Connectors**: Commonly uses **LC**, **SC**, **ST**, and **FC** connectors.

### **2. Fiber Optic Connectors**

Connectors are used to join fiber optic cables to network equipment. Different types of connectors are used based on the type of fiber cable and application.

#### **ST Connector**
- **Type**: **Round**, bayonet-style connector.
- **Connection Method**: Twist and lock into place.
- **Usage**: Commonly used in multi-mode fiber installations.

#### **SC Connector**
- **Type**: **Square**, push-pull connector.
- **Connection Method**: Pushes in and locks into place.
- **Usage**: Popular in both multi-mode and single-mode applications. Known for its durability and ease of use.

#### **FC Connector**
- **Type**: **Screwed-in** connector.
- **Connection Method**: Screw-on to ensure a secure connection.
- **Usage**: Often used in high-vibration environments due to its secure connection.

#### **LC Connector**
- **Type**: **Smaller** connector, often used for high-density applications.
- **Connection Method**: Push-pull latch.
- **Usage**: Common in both single-mode and multi-mode fiber. Itâ€™s compact and allows for high-density installations.

#### **MT-RJ Connector**
- **Type**: **High-density** connector with two connectors in one.
- **Connection Method**: Push-pull design.
- **Usage**: Used where space is limited and high-density connections are needed.

### **3. Fiber Polishing Styles**

Fiber optic connectors require precise polishing to ensure optimal performance and minimal signal loss.

#### **PC (Physical Contact)**
- **Description**: Older style of connector with slightly rounded edges.
- **Polishing**: The fibers are polished to create a slight curve, which makes physical contact.
- **Usage**: Used in older installations; not as effective in reducing signal loss as newer styles.

#### **UPC (Ultra Physical Contact)**
- **Description**: More rounded than PC connectors.
- **Polishing**: The fibers are polished to a more rounded surface, improving performance.
- **Usage**: Provides better performance than PC, reducing signal loss and reflections.

#### **APC (Angled Physical Contact)**
- **Description**: Connectors have a 8-degree angled end face.
- **Polishing**: The angled end face reduces back reflections and signal loss.
- **Usage**: Provides the highest quality connection with minimal signal loss and is used in high-precision applications.

### **Summary**

- **Fiber Optic Cables**:
  - **Multi-Mode**: Uses LEDs, orange color, larger core, short-distance applications.
  - **Single-Mode**: Uses lasers, yellow color, smaller core, long-distance applications.

- **Fiber Connectors**:
  - **ST**: Round, twist-lock.
  - **SC**: Square, push-pull.
  - **FC**: Screwed-in.
  - **LC**: Smaller, high-density, push-pull.
  - **MT-RJ**: High-density, two connectors in one.

- **Polishing Styles**:
  - **PC**: Slightly rounded, older style.
  - **UPC**: More rounded, better performance.
  - **APC**: Angled, minimal signal loss, high quality.
